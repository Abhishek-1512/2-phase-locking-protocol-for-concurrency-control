# 2-phase-locking-protocol-for-concurrency-control
This project is about implementing a program that simulates the behavior of rigorous two-phase locking (2PL) protocol for concurrency control. 

The methods used to prevent deadlock are wound-wait, wait-die and cautious wait method.
The possible operations are: b(begin transaction), r(read item), w(write item), and e(end transaction) followed by the transaction id.
